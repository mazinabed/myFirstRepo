Hello everyone!
I start working on my Portfolio page using HTML and CSS. It is a fun and challenging one but i think i made it. 
Some of the challenges i faced is the heading as I want my name to be inside a box, so instead of using H1, i used the figuer tag and create a box and I placed my name inside the box. (I thought this will be cool).
The other challenge i faced was when clicking on the navegation panel it opens in a new page. So, i was able to fix it by placing the nav ul li in all the html and this was a fix.
